// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

n=Value
If n%2==0
Then Print "Even"
Else Print "Odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

A) input n1,n2,n3,n4,n5
B) avg = (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
C) If(n1 < n2) 
Set max to n2 
Else Set max to n1 
If(n3 > max) 
Set max to n3 
If(n4 > max) 
Set max to n4 
If(n5 > max) 
Set max to n5 
Print max 
If(n1 > n2) 
Set min to n2 
Else Set min to n1
If(n3 < min) 
Set min to n3 
If(n4 < min) 
Set min to n4 
If(n5 < min) 
Set min to n5 
Print min

D) (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5 = avg
Print (avg + " is the Average")


Print (max + " is the largest number")

Print (Min + " is the Smallest number")
